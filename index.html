    <hr>
    <p align="justify"> Welcome to my blog, I am currently graduating in game development at FIAP in Brazil, SÃ£o Paulo. Here I will be posting my researches
        along with reports of projects I am developing. I also intend to post my progress while I learn about artistic aspects that compose
        a game, as I think that this is essential to improve myself as a Game Developer. The purpose of this blog is to: Track my progress while
        I sharp up my skills; Demonstrate my line of thought as I am developing a project; Have everything I did registered here to see my evolution
        . I am also going to talk about personal experiences of games that I have played and gaming events I have attended, reviewing then
        in a way that helps me understand what makes a good game and what makes players enjoy them. You can check out some of my Steam games clicking on
        the "About" page above.</p>
