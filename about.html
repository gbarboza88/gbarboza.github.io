    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <hr>
    <p align="justify"> I do not remember exactly at what age I started playing games, but the first console I played was the PlayStation One
                        that my cousin had. I played Street Fighter Alpha 3, Grand Theft Auto 2 and King of Fighters 99. My father gave
                        me my first computer around that time, it was an IBM with white case.<br><br> It was a super low-end PC and it introduced 
                        me to the world of emulation. It could not run Game Boy Advance games but it was able to run Game Boy Color games.
                        The first game I played on this PC was Pokemon Crystal and it made me fall in love with the franchise. I also got
                        introduced to other Nintendo IPs that I grew up playing, so among my favorite franchises are Pokemon, Zelda and Mario.
                        The first console I got was a PlayStation 2, where I played one of my favorite games ever, Resident Evil 4, and many
                        other Capcom classics (Onimusha, Devil May Cry, Mega Man X Collection, Marvel vs. Capcom 2, Haunting Ground, etc.).<br><br>
                        I also played even more Capcom Playstation One games through backwards compatibility (Dino Crisis, Mega Man Legends).
                        Outside of Capcom games, Shadow of the Colossus is one of the best games I have ever played on the PS2. Konami games
                        also made a huge part of my childhood, mainly Metal Gear Solid (all of them, including MSX ones) and Silent Hill, my
                        favorite horror franchise (I love horror games).<br><br> After the PS2, I got a Nintendo DS and played games like Pokemon Platinum,
                        The World Ends with You, Kingdom Hearts Re:Coded, Final Fantasy IV Remake. DS made me a huge fan o J-RPGs, it made me start
                        playing Final Fantasy games and I am glad about it.It also made me start playing Visual Novels after I tried Zero Escape: Nonary Games.
                        When I got my first job I started buying more consoles and now I have a PlayStation 4, PlayStation 3, 
                        PlayStation 2, Nintendo Wii, PlayStation Vita, Nintendo DS Lite, Nintendo Switch and a Sega Saturn (Almost all these consoles have some 
                        kind of backwards compatibility, something I value a lot).<br><br> Even though there are several advantages playing retro games on emulator, I
                        value the original experience a lot. Now a days I play a lot of PC games through Steam. I like competitive gaming a lot. Currently
                        I am playing fighting games competitively, but I already played a lot of things competitively, from Pokemon to Counter-Strike.
                        I spend a lot of time gaming, I will post a list of my most played Steam games below. I do not have a list of games I played
                        on console sadly, so my Steam games are the only thing I can show. </p>
